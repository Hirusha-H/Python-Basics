# Note: Not Completed. There are more to teach you guys :)

# There are 6 Datatypes in Python
- Numbers (int, float, complex)
- Strings

I'll add others after teach you guys about them :D


## Numbers
There are 3 types of Numbers,
1. Integer (`<class 'int'>`)
2. Float (`<class 'float'>`)
3. Complex (`<class 'complex'>`)

### Integer
Integer is a whole number. Like `10`, `18`, `4344980`. This can be either positive or negative. but it can't contain decimals. And there is no limit for length.
